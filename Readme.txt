If you finish and release a product using Shader Forge, I would appreciate a mention of Shader Forge in the credits :)


Selling shaders created in Shader Forge:
----------------------------------------
Shaders created in SF can be used freely in commercial and non-commercial projects with no restrictions.
If you are creating assets for the asset store using SF shaders, people will probably want to know if the shaders are created with Shader Forge,
so they know they can easily be modified!
I would also be super happy if you were to credit SF in the asset store description,
linked to either the website http://www.acegikmo.com/shaderforge/ or the asset store page http://u3d.as/6cc :)
