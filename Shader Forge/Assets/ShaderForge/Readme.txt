Please avoid sending me questions like "How do I make a shader that ________ ? ".
I'm unfortunately unable to respond to all shader inquiries, given the volume of users and the limited time I have.
Try to keep that to the forum threads so that others can see and potentially help you too. (Though I will occasionally respond there as well)

Website:
--------
http://www.acegikmo.com/shaderforge/  (Includes documentation, tutorials, links to forum threads, and more!)


Installation:
-------------
Put the "ShaderForge" folder in the project you want to use Shader Forge in.
If you have an old version of Shader Forge installed, remove the *entire* ShaderForge folder before installing the new one


Legal Stuff / Licensing:
------------------------
Shader Forge is licensed per-seat, as with all other editor extensions, according to Unity's EULA.
This means that in order for a team to use Shader Forge, everyone who want to be able to use it, needs their own license.
If you finish and release a product using Shader Forge, I would appreciate a mention of Shader Forge in the credits :)


Selling shaders created in Shader Forge:
----------------------------------------
Shaders created in SF can be used freely in commercial and non-commercial projects with no restrictions.
If you are creating assets for the asset store using SF shaders, people will probably want to know if the shaders are created with Shader Forge,
so they know they can easily be modified!
I would also be super happy if you were to credit SF in the asset store description,
linked to either the website http://www.acegikmo.com/shaderforge/ or the asset store page http://u3d.as/6cc :)
