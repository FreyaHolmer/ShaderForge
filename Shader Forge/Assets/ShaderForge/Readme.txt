README - SHADER FORGE BETA:
---------------------------

First off - Massive thanks for purchasing Shader Forge!
You hopefully can't wait to get started, but you should give this document a read, it's not that long :)

Shader Forge is currently in beta, which means that things could potentially change in a way that alters your shaders,
when opening them with a newer version. I will, however, try to avoid this. I honestly don't think it will happen, but it could.

Contact / Support:

Avoid sending me mails along the lines of "How do I make a shader that ________ ".
Keep that to the forum threads so others can see and potentially help you too, though I will respond there as well :)

Alternatively, you can use Twitter: @JoachimHolmer or the hashtag #ShaderForge

Report bugs and/or request features here: http://shaderforge.userecho.com/


Website:
--------
http://www.acegikmo.com/shaderforge/  (Includes documentation, tutorials, links to forum threads, and more!)


Installation:
-------------
Put the "ShaderForge" folder in the project you want to use Shader Forge in.
If you have an old version of Shader Forge installed, remove the *entire* ShaderForge folder before installing the new one


Version Control:
----------------
When running Shader Forge with version control, after the initial commit of SF, be sure to add the "ShaderForgeInternal.mat" material to the ignore list. (This behaviour will be mitigated in future versions)


Legal Stuff / Licensing:
------------------------
Shader Forge is licensed per-seat, as with all other editor extensions, according to Unity's EULA.
This means that in order for a team to use Shader Forge, everyone who want to be able to use it, needs their own license.
If you finish and release a product in Unity, using Shader Forge, I would appreciate a mention of Shader Forge in the credits :)


Selling shaders created in Shader Forge:
----------------------------------------
Shaders created in SF can be used freely in commercial and non-commercial projects with no restrictions.
If you are creating assets for the asset store using SF shaders, people will probably want to know if the shaders are created with Shader Forge,
so they know they can easily be modified!
I would also be super happy if you were to credit SF in the asset store description,
linked to either the website http://www.acegikmo.com/shaderforge/ or the asset store page http://u3d.as/6cc :)
